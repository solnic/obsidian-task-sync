# Workflow & Task Management

> **MANDATORY:** Use the task system, not text lists. One task at a time. Mark complete only after squashing/merging all commits.

## First Actions
1. Check current branch; create topic branch from main/master if needed
2. For any development, use the actual task system

## Strict Sequence for Each Task
1. Create or identify a task
2. Locate existing test file (extend if possible; new only if required)
3. Add minimal code skeleton if needed, so test fails due to assertion, not import
4. Write a failing test, show real output
5. Commit with `WIP - ` prefix
6. Implement minimal code to make the test pass; verify
7. Run all tests; if passing, commit (removing `WIP - `)
8. Squash commits; mark the task complete; move to next

---

### STOP AND ASK IF:
- The test expectations seem wrong, or don't fit the real requirement
- A failing test isn't obvious or conflicts with code patterns
- Unsure whether to extend or create a new test
