# Project Context

**Current Phase:** Transition from Obsidian plugin to Svelte app with Obsidian extension support. (Old plugin code is in `old-stuff/` for reference.)

**Status:** Unreleased

**Testing Commands:**

- `npm test` — All tests
- `npm run test:e2e` — E2E only
- `npm run test:e2e:failed` — Only failed E2E
- All new E2E must use Playwright, not Vitest

**Docker Constraint:** Do NOT use Playwright UI commands in container environments.
