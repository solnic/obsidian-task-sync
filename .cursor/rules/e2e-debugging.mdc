# E2E Debugging with Playwright (Docker)

- **NEVER** run Playwright UI commands (e.g., `npx playwright show-trace`) — they do NOT work in Docker containers
- **Analyze artifacts by:**
  - Checking `tests/e2e/debug/` for screenshots, traces, logs, and HTML
  - Reading trace and log files programmatically if necessary
  - Adding `console.log` or screenshots during Playwright tests
- **On E2E test failures:**
  1. Read output carefully
  2. Analyze screenshots, logs, DOM, and trace data (programmatically)
  3. Add more debug output/reduce the scenario until the cause is clear
