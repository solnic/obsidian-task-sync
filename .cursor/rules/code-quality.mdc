# Code Quality: Confident, Non-Defensive Coding

- **NEVER** use fallback chains like `foo || bar || 'default'` — Trust your data contracts; fail fast if violated.
- **NEVER** wrap business logic, utility, or internal functions in unnecessary try/catch.
  - Only catch errors at boundaries (UI/API, external, background jobs) and provide meaningful, user-facing feedback if needed.
- **ALWAYS** validate at boundaries (API handler, form) and then trust that data everywhere in internal code.
- **NO** silent error swallowing or pointless catch-and-rethrow.
- **Explicit validation/fail-fast strategy:** At the boundary, e.g. `if (!data.foo) throw Error('foo required')`; after that, treat as safe and avoid duplicate validation.
- **Null/undefined handling:** Fallbacks only for _truly_ optional fields, never for expected or contract-mandated ones.
